    "content": "Okay, let's start with the core idea of a Python function.  Think of a function as a mini-program within your larger program. It takes some input (or none), does something with that input, and then gives you back an output (or none).\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n  \"\"\"This function greets the person passed in as a parameter.\"\"\"\n  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ngreet(\"Gud\")\n```\n\nThis defines a function called `greet` that takes one input (`name`).  It then prints a greeting using that name.  The `\"\"\" \"\"\"` contains a *docstring*, which is helpful documentation.  `greet(\"Gud\")` *calls* the function, providing \"Gud\" as the input.\n\nDo you have any questions about this example, or would you like to see a function that returns a value instead of just printing?"
